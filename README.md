# Let-s-Play-
A mobile-first web application designed as a "Tinder For Board Gamers" to help people who play board games find other local people to play with using a tinder-style matching system.

In its current unfinished state the app is populated with test accounts all based in Barcelona. Clicking "No thank you" to a profile will remove it from your future matches. Clicking "Let's Play!" will add them to Your Matches. Once matched, users can use the chat functionality.

To use: Register an account with any email address/password, making sure to set your city to Barcelona as all test data is there.

Unfinished:
  - Users should only see other users in the same city / local area. (In the future, location should be based off mobile GPS instead of typed city)
  - Clicking "Let's Play" should not instantly match a user, but make them a "potential" match for the second user.
  - Users should only match with another user when *both* parties say "Let's Play".
  - Users should have profile pictures.
